Summary:
Implementing a Command Line Interpreter for UNIX / Mac Operating Systems. This project helped us understand the features of how Unix Shell interface works and the functionality and usage of various system calls such as fork(), execvp(), wait. We established a parent child relationship to read the command from the user on the shell interface and provide the result of the command.
